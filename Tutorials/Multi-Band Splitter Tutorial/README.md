# Multi-Band-Splitter-Tutorial

This tutorial explains how to build filter banks which split the audio band into N sub-bands. If no processing is applied to the sub-bands, the original signal may be reconstructed (apart from a phase factor) by adding all sub-bands.

If you want a filter bank only for analysis without reconstruction, you don’t need this tutorial.
